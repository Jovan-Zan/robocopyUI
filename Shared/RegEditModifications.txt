This document describes what actions must be taken in order to add "RoboCopy" to "SendTo" menu and "RoboPaste" to "right-click" menu.

NOTE: These will be done automatically during installation.  

1) RoboCopy
Add shortcut to RoboCopy.exe to SendTo folder, which is at:
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo
and name the shortcut "RoboCopy"

2) RoboPaste
Add 2 keys to Windows registry:

1) Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
	   Directory
		   Background
			   shell
				   + RoboPaste

2) Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
	   Directory
		   Background
			   shell
				   RoboPaste
					   + command
						   @default = "(PasteApp.exe path)" "%v"

default is an attribute of key command and is of type REG_SZ. Set its value to "(PasteApp.exe path)" "%v". 
PasteApp.exe path should point to installation folder of robocopyUI.
%v is replaced with the path of directory where the user made a right-click.
